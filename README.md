# Hand Prosthesis Controller with Deep Learning and Tensorflow Lite

## Disclaimer

This work was created to be my final project from my college (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte - UFRN), it was made wih the help of my Professor Advisor Helton Maia.

## About and Objectives

This project has the objective to create a Hand Prosthesis Controller using Deep Learning techniques, in which the model created with those techniques were embedded in a low energy microcontroller with the porpouse to run in real time, and should be low cost and acessible. To solve this problem were used common tools, such as TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, Numpy, Librosa, and Scypy.

One of the main objectives of this project is to study how electromyography signals works, and how Deep Learning techniques can learning its paterns. This is a very interesting topic in Health. The other main objective of this project is to use TinyML techniques to embed Deep Learning models, TinyML here is a set of techniques that enable use Machine Learning/Deep Learning Models in low energy microcontrolers.
